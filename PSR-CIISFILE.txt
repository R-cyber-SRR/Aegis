Project Title:
AI Model for Flagging Suspicious Transactions Using Historical Data Behaviour Profiling

Project Overview
1.Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an AI-based model that identifies and flags suspicious financial transactions in real-time or batch processing. The model will leverage historical transaction data to create behaviour profiles for users, accounts, or entities. By comparing new transactions against these profiles, the system will detect anomalies that may indicate fraud, money laundering, or other illicit activities.
2.Background
In the financial sector, fraudulent transactions cost billions annually. Traditional rule-based systems are limited in detecting sophisticated fraud patterns. This AI model uses machine learning techniques, such as anomaly detection and behavioural analytics, to improve accuracy and reduce false positives by profiling normal behaviour from historical data.
3.Scope
 In Scope: Data preprocessing, model training, anomaly detection, flagging mechanism, basic dashboard for visualization, and evaluation on historical datasets.
Out of Scope: Real-time integration with banking systems, regulatory compliance audits, hardware deployment, or advanced features like explainable AI (unless specified in extensions).

Functional Requirements
FR1: Data Ingestion
•	The system shall ingest historical transaction data in formats such as CSV, JSON, or SQL databases.
•	Support for features including transaction amount, timestamp, user ID, merchant ID, location, device info, and transaction type.
FR2: Behaviour Profiling
•	Create user/account profiles based on historical data, including metrics like average transaction amount, frequency, time of day patterns, geographical preferences, and spending categories.
•	Use unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering) to group similar behaviours.

FR3: Anomaly Detection Model
•	Train an AI model (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, or LSTM for sequence analysis) to detect deviations from profiled behaviours.
•	Flag transactions with a suspicion score above a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.8 on a 0-1 scale).
FR4: Flagging and Alerting
•	Generate alerts for flagged transactions, including details like transaction ID, suspicion score, and reasons (e.g., "Unusual amount" or "Abnormal location").
•	Output flags in a report format (e.g., CSV or API endpoint).
FR5: Model Retraining
•	Support periodic retraining with new historical data to adapt to evolving behaviours.
FR6: User Interface
•	A simple web-based dashboard to view flagged transactions, profiles, and model performance metrics.

Non-Functional Requirements
NFR1: Performance
•	Model inference time: < 100ms per transaction.
•	Handle up to 10,000 transactions per hour in batch mode.
NFR2: Accuracy
•	Target precision: > 90% for fraud detection.
•	Recall: > 85% to minimize missed frauds.
•	Use metrics like F1-score, ROC-AUC for evaluation.
NFR3: Scalability
•	Scalable to datasets with millions of transactions using distributed computing (e.g., Spark).
NFR4: Security and Privacy
•	Comply with data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR simulation).
•	Anonymize sensitive data during processing.
NFR5: Reliability
•	Model uptime: 99.9%.
•	Error handling for invalid data inputs.
NFR6: Usability
•	Dashboard should be intuitive, with filters for date, user, and suspicion level.
Data Requirements
Data Sources
•	Historical transaction data: At least 1 year of records, with labelled fraud instances if available (supervised learning fallback).
•	Sample Datasets: Use public sources like IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (Kaggle) or synthetic generators.
Data Features
•	Mandatory: Timestamp, Amount, User ID, Merchant ID, Transaction Type.
•	Optional: IP Address, Device Fingerprint, Location Coordinates.
Data Volume
•	Training: 100,000+ transactions.
•	Testing: 20% holdout set.

Technical Requirements
Technology Stack
•	Programming Language: Python 3.x
•	Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch (ML models), Flask/Dash (dashboard), SQLAlchemy (database).
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebooks for development, Docker for containerization.

Risks and Assumptions
Assumptions
•	Access to clean, labeled historical data.
•	Domain expertise available for feature engineering.
Risks
•	Data quality issues leading to poor model performance (Mitigation: Robust preprocessing).
